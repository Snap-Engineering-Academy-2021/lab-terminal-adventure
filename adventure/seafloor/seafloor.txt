    After several moments of peaceful floating, you make a gentle landing on 
    the seafloor, several hundered meters away from the sunken ship. You appear
    to be at the edge of a plateau whose edges are encrusted with beautiful 
    corals. 

    Both sunken_ship and coral_reef are directories, so use the "cd" command
    to go into whichever one you want.
