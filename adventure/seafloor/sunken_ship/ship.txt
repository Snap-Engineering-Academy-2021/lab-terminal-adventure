    The sunken ship is lying on the seafloor at a slight angle. From the remains
    of its masts and rigging, you can tell it's from the age before ships were made
    of steel and powered by engines. You climb up in the deck, and see a large hole
    allowing access to the inner chambers. You flick on your suit's light and
    go inside.
