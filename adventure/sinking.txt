    As you are lowered off the edge of the research boat, you wave goodbye to 
    your friends. The diving suit is tight and stiff, and your vision is limited
    to the round window in front of you. Your head goes below water, and the 
    sharp details of the boat are replaced by a wash of blues and greens. Below 
    you is an endless expanse of water. You can just barely see the sunken ship 
    on the seafloor. You relax, allowing your body to gently float down...

    To continue, you need to go into the seafloor directory by typing 
    "cd seafloor". Once you're there, type "ls" to see what's inside.
